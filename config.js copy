After prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned after protests and movement from mostly Oromo youth, PM Abiy Ahmed was elected and transitionally assigned as acting PM of Ethiopia. Soon after taking office, Ahmed made drastic reforms and restructured the government bodies against the constitution. He decided to give away border towns of Badme and its surroundings to Eritrea without consulting the inhabitants and recieved Nobel Peace Prize for it. This gave him a green light to wage war on people of Tigray in a camoflage of a peace maker. Today Ethiopia is waging war against its own people in Tigray, the northern most semi-self adminstrative state.',

The evidence we have collected so far from survivors who fled to Sudan shows that civilian Tigrayans were stabbed and hacked to death with machetes and axes by the Amhara militias and the Fano rebel group. For example, Mr. Tesfay Mitiku (60), Mr. Aregay Weldu (82), Mr. Mehari Niguse (47), Mr. Birhane Gebrehiwet Gebremedhin (28), Mr. Haftu (80) with his wife are some of the Tigrayan civilians stabbed and hacked to death with machetes and axes.

The soldiers in the video were speaking Amharic, Ethiopia’s administrative language and the native tongue of the Amhara people. At least one military uniform seen in the videos also displayed the markings of the Ethiopian flag. <br>On 16 June 2021, new footage surfaced on social media showing soldiers executing civilians at a cliff edge.

In some instances this was temporary; in others, the armed occupation continues. In Mugulat, in eastern Tigray, Eritrean soldiers are still using the health facility as their base. The hospital in Abiy Addi in central Tigray, which serves a population of half a million people, was occupied by Ethiopian forces until early March.&#34;<br> <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/news/widespread-destruction-health-facilities-ethiopias-tigray-region">Read More from MSF Doctors Without Borders</a>',
