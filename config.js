        "Ethiopia is home to many nations and nationalities of several ethnicities and languages. In 2018, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn resigned after protests and youth movement, mostly from the Oromo Region. Abiy Ahmed was selected and transitionally assigned to act as prime minister of Ethiopia. Soon after taking office, Ahmed made drastic reforms, restructured the government bodies and marginalized the Tigray Region and its ruling party. He made secret agreements with the long-time dicatator of neighboring Eritrea which afffect border towns of Badme and its surroundings without consulting the inhabitants at the border in the northern most semi-self adminstrative state of Tigray and their leaders. He recieved Nobel Peace Prize for what was advertised as &#39normalization of relations or a peace deal with Eritrea&#39. He then postponed the 2020 national election against the constitution of the Federal Demoratic Republic of Ethiopia. To the contrary the Tigray Regional Government held its own regional election in September 2020 in accordance with the constitution. This gave Abiy a pretext to wage war on people of Tigray while the Nobel Prize served him as camoflage of a peace maker. Today Ethiopia is continues waging war against its own people in Tigray.",

We have also identified by name many of the massacred.  What happened in Mai Kadra is a horrific and senseless massacre of ethnic Tigrayans. The evidence we have collected so far from survivors who fled to Sudan shows that civilian Tigrayans were stabbed and hacked to death with machetes and axes by the Amhara militias and the Fano rebel group. For example, Mr. Tesfay Mitiku (60), Mr. Aregay Weldu (82), Mr. Mehari Niguse (47), Mr. Birhane Gebrehiwet Gebremedhin (28), Mr. Haftu (80) with his wife are some of the Tigrayan civilians stabbed and hacked to death with machetes and axes.

        '&#34;ADDIS ABABA/NEW YORK, March 15, 2021—Health facilities across Ethiopia&#39;s Tigray region have been looted, vandalized, and destroyed in a deliberate and widespread attack on health care, the international medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said today, sharing the findings of an assessment by MSF teams.<br>One-fifth of the health facilities visited by MSF teams were occupied by soldiers. In some instances this was temporary; in others, the armed occupation continues. In Mugulat, in eastern Tigray, Eritrean soldiers are still using the health facility as their base. The hospital in Abiy Addi in central Tigray, which serves a population of half a million people, was occupied by Ethiopian forces until early March.&#34;<br> <b><a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/news/widespread-destruction-health-facilities-ethiopias-tigray-region">Read More from MSF Doctors Without Borders</a>',
